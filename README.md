# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application that shortens URLs. It is built using Node for the web server, Express as middleware, and EJS as a template engine. Bootstrap is also used as the CSS framework. Its functionality allows users to
submit URLs that are automatically shortened. Users may view all their created URLs, edit the redirected URLs, and delete them (CRUD functionality).
